I can't say for sure but I have the impression that very few people (if any) in the IT field have read the "[Message to Garcia](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/can-you-carry-a-message-to-garcia/)" by Elbert Hubbard. I have read it and I dare to consider myself one of the people, who are able to "bring the message".

There always will be someone who is more creative, knows more or works faster than me. I am aware of that and I accept it. Still, I am quite confident of being a better prepared professional than the average IT guy.

I have more than 20 years of experience in programming, database modelling, system design and architecture, business processes analysis and automation, basic  accounting principles, Linux and network administration, Asterisk (FreePBX) configuration, ARM-based microcontrollers, etc.

I have successfully solved various business-related software and hardware challenges. Being able to combine both low-level and high-level allows me to work on wide range of tasks. I have reverse engineered and fully decompiled about a dozen Delphi components and desktop applications.

Assembler was my 2nd language (after BASIC) and my first significant application was an audio player for tracker music (do you remember those MOD, STM, 669, XM file formats) entirely written in Assembler - with bass/treble digital filters and oscilloscope.

My long employment in a non-IT company puts me ahead of many casual developers - I now have the eye and understanding for business-related things which are way too foreign for many of my fellow developers. I know what impact my software had on the business.

I like digging deeper and understanding the root cause. I am quite good at debugging and troubleshooting - and this is not an empty claim.

Some of my achievements:
- developed 2 full-blown complex ERP systems
- developed 2 accounting / warehousing applications with OLAP reporting and hierarchical multi-dimensional accounts
- developed Windows service daemon for logging Skype chat messages to a company-wide database (with REST API) in real-time
- ported one large desktop application (Interactive Delphi Reconstructor) from Borland C-Builder to Delphi
- implemented a company-wide real-time backup solution using Yadis or Bvckup, Samba and NappIT on OpenIndiana
- developed Linux daemon for controlling large LED strips based on WS2811 (and organized into X/Y matrix) through TCP/UDP socket
- developed combined CDR reporting, matching information from the local Asterisk PBX with the billing information from VoIP providers
- implemented Linux daemon for reading SMDR/CDR data from Panasonic PBX TDA-200 and storing in MySQL with reporting capabilities
- developed custom reporting module for a 3rd party security access control system and integrated it with the in-house ERP system
- worked on hundreds of small and medium projects as a freelancer (and I continue working on some of them)

I choose my clients as carefully as they choose their contractors. I value honesty, respect, good communication, good sense of humor, intelligence, modesty, kindness, generosity.

I prefer to develop from scratch custom business solutions for automating the workflow of tiny and small businesses. My previous experience from the 2 ERP systems I already developed (and which are used 24/7 by customers and employees) is of enormous benefit. I feel truly happy when I am able to help a client by removing the burden and simplifying the workflow.

What can you expect from me when I'm hired as a contractor:
- educating and explaining the things which are too technical and unfamiliar to you
- asking good questions
- providing meaningful advices and recommendations
- not trying to suck additional money by finding extra work of low business value
- understanding your real business needs, pain points and goals
- keeping you from making worthless or unwise expenses
- excellent responsiveness
- taking precautions against damaging your data
- really listening to you and your problems
- acknowledging my faults and not blaming others for them
- enjoying good jokes
- not quietly disappearing after being faced with some tough challenge
- honestly admitting when I do not know something or not being qualified enough
- not over-complicating the solution
- being available for support and further assistance after the final deployment

I discovered too late in my life that there are only 3 kinds of people in the world:
- those who know what needs to be done
- those who know how to do it
- those who don't care

Let's have a chat and see whether I can do the things that you need to be done.
